# Firewall

### _A firewall is a security system (either hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet) to protect against unauthorized access, malicious activities, or potential threats._
