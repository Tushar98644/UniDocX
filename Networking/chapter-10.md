# Firewall

_A firewall is a security system (either hardware or software) that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks (like the internet) to protect against unauthorized access, malicious activities, or potential threats._

## Whitelist and Blacklist in Firewall

_Whitelist: A whitelist is like a VIP list that contains approved or allowed entities (such as IP addresses, applications, or users) permitted to access or communicate with a network or system._

_Blacklist: A blacklist is like a list of banned or prohibited entities (such as IP addresses, applications, or users) that are restricted from accessing or communicating with a network or system._
