# Leased Line

_A leased line is a dedicated and fixed-bandwidth telecommunications line that's rented or leased from a service provider to connect two specific locations, such as offices or data centers. It provides a direct and private connection for transmitting data, voice, or video traffic between the locations._

_Simple Scenario: Imagine you have a road that connects your home directly to your friend's house without any other cars using it. This road is exclusively yours, and you can use it whenever you want. Similarly, a leased line is like having your own private "road" between two places—your office and a data center, for instance—reserved solely for your use._
