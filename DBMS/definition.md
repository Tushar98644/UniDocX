# Database 

A database is an organised collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just a database.

# DBMS

Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users' data while considering appropriate security measures. It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data. In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.

Advantages:

- Improved data sharing
- Improved data security
- Better data integration
- Minimised data inconsistency
- Improved data access
- Improved decision making
- Improved end-user productivity

# RDBMS

A Relational Database Management system (RDBMS) is a database management system that is based on the relational model. It has the following major components: Table, Record/Tuple/Row, Field, and Column/Attribute. Examples of the most popular RDBMS are MYSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server database.

Relational databases have the following properties:

- Values are atomic.
- All of the values in a column have the same data type.
- Each row is unique.
- The sequence of columns is insignificant.
- The sequence of rows is insignificant.
- Each column has a unique name.
- Integrity constraints maintain data consistency across multiple tables.
