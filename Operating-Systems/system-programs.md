## System Programs 

_System programs, also known as system software, are a collection of software applications that manage and facilitate the operation of a computer system. These programs provide essential services to both the user and other software applications. System programs interact closely with the operating system and handle various low-level details of system operation._

#### _Examples:_

_Operating System: The core system program that manages hardware resources and provides a platform for other software._

_Device Drivers: Software components that enable communication between the operating system and hardware devices._

_Utilities: Tools and programs that perform specific system-related tasks, such as disk formatting, file management, and system diagnostics._
