## NV-RAM

_NVRAM stands for Non-Volatile Random Access Memory. It refers to a type of computer memory that retains its stored data even when the power is turned off. Unlike traditional RAM (Random Access Memory), which is volatile and loses its content when the power is removed, NVRAM is designed to be non-volatile, ensuring that data persists through power cycles._
