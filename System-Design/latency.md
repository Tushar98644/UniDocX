# Latency of monolith and distributed system 

_Monolithic System: Often exhibits lower latency as components communicate internally within the same codebase without the need for extensive network communication._ </br>

_Distributed System: Introduces latency due to network communication between different components distributed across various machines or locations. However, optimization strategies can help manage and mitigate latency in a distributed setup._
