# Basic oops concepts

## Abstract class   

- Abstract class is a class that is declared abstract - it may or may not include abstract methods.
- An instance of an abstract class cannot be created.

## Concrete class

- A class that is not declared abstract is called a concrete class.
- It can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.
- An instance of a concrete class can be created.
- A concrete class must implement all the abstract methods of the abstract class it inherits.
